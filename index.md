# About Me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), under the supervision of Prof. [John C.S. Lui](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Before this, I earned a B.Sc. from the Advanced Class in Mathematics and Physics for Information Science at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). My current academic interests focus on **Online Learning** and **Large Language Model (LLM)**. As an amateur enthusiast in mathematics, I am particularly keen on exploring the mathematical aspects of LLMs. I am always open to potential collaborations, so please feel free to reach out.
