## About me
I am a new Ph.D. student in [Advanced Networking and System Research Laboratory (ANSRLab)](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). I am interested in bandit theory and application. I am always open to possible collaborations. Please feel free to contact me.
